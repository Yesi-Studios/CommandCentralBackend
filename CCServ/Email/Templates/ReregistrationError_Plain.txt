Re-Registration Attempt

---------------------

Hello @Model.FriendlyName,
 
    An unknown user attempted to restart the account registration process for your account.  In order to do this, a user must provide your SSN.  
 
    The development team has been CCed on this email and we'll investigate further to help protect your privacy and security.
 
    Unless of course you tried to reclaim your own account.  If that's the case, please contact us before we release the trained monkeys.  Getting them back in their cages is always a nightmare.
 
Sincerely,
 
The Command Central Team
