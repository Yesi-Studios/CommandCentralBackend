                A user attempted to claim the account (Id : '{1}') tied to this email account even though it has already been claimed by you.  We successfully denied the user access to your account but this is most likely malicious activity and should be investigated further.  At the very least, an unkown user knew your SSN in order to attempt to start the registration process.  The development team has been CCed on this email.  You will be contacted for further assistance.
