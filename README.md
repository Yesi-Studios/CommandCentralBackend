# README #

In order to build the project, you'll need Visual Studio 2013 and you'll need to rebuild the Nuget packages.  Everything after that should load just fine.  The project is also reliant on a database and, of course, a certain schema.  We're working on creating a schema tracking system but we haven't implemented that yet.
